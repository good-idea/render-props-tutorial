/**
	In this demo, we are using the <Route> 'children' prop to get the location and history,
	which we pass along to the Tabs component.

	In practice, this would get tedious - you would need to do the same thing every time you wanted
	to use <Tabs>. A better way to achive this would be by using the `withRouter` HOC provided by RR.

	We would simply change our export to look like this:

	export default withRouter(Tabs)

	(But since this lesson is about render props we're using render props!)
